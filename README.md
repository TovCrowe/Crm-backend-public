- **Database Flexibility**: Support for both H2 (development) and PostgreSQL (production) databases [4](#0-3) 

## Technology Stack

- **Java 17** [5](#0-4) 
- **Spring Boot 3.4.1** [6](#0-5) 
- **Spring Data JPA** for database operations [7](#0-6) 
- **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization [8](#0-7) 
- **Spring WebSocket** for real-time communication [9](#0-8) 
- **Lombok** for reducing boilerplate code [10](#0-9) 
- **H2 Database** (development) / **PostgreSQL** (production) [4](#0-3)

## API Endpoints

### Client Management
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/clients` | Get all clients |
| GET | `/clients/{id}` | Get client by ID |
| POST | `/clients` | Create new client |
| PUT | `/clients/{id}` | Update existing client |
| DELETE | `/clients/{id}` | Delete client | [11](#0-10) 

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle (wrapper included)
- PostgreSQL (for production) or H2 (for development)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TovCrowe/Crm-backend-public.git
cd Crm-backend-public
```

### 2. Build the Project
```bash
./gradlew build
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

## Database Configuration

### Development (H2)
The application is configured to use H2 database for development, which provides an in-memory database that's perfect for testing and development.

### Production (PostgreSQL)
For production deployment, configure PostgreSQL connection in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

## Client Data Model

The client entity includes the following fields:
- **ID**: Auto-generated primary key
- **Name**: Client's full name
- **Company**: Client's company name
- **Email**: Client's email address
- **Phone**: Client's phone number
- **Notes**: Additional notes about the client [12](#0-11) 

## Testing

Run the test suite with:
```bash
./gradlew test
``` [13](#0-12)

## Notes

This README is based on the current project structure and configuration. The application uses Spring Boot's standard architecture with a clean separation of concerns through Controllers, Services, Models, and DTOs. The project includes security configuration and WebSocket support, suggesting it's designed for real-time CRM functionality. The dual database support (H2/PostgreSQL) makes it suitable for both development and production environments.
